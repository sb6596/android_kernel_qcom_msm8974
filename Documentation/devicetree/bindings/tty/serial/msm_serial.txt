* Qualcomm MSM UART

Required properties:
- compatible :
	- "qcom,msm-uart", and one of "qcom,msm-hsuart" or
	  "qcom,msm-lsuart".
- reg : offset and length of the register set for the device
	for the hsuart operating in compatible mode, there should be a
	second pair describing the gsbi registers.
- interrupts : should contain the uart interrupt.

There are two different UART blocks used in MSM devices,
"qcom,msm-hsuart" and "qcom,msm-lsuart".  The msm-serial driver is
able to handle both of these, and matches against the "qcom,msm-uart"
as the compatibility.

The registers for the "qcom,msm-hsuart" device need to specify both
register blocks, even for the common driver.

Example:

	uart@19c400000 {
		compatible = "qcom,msm-hsuart", "qcom,msm-uart";
		reg = <0x19c40000 0x1000>,
		      <0x19c00000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <195>;
	};

* Qualcomm MSM HSUART

Required properties:
- compatible : one of:
	- "qcom,msm-lsuart-v14"
- reg : offset and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts : should contain the uart interrupt.

Aliases:
An alias may optionally be used to bind the serial device to a tty device
(ttyHSLx) with a given line number. Aliases are of the form serial<n> where <n>
is an integer representing the line number to use. On systems with multiple
serial devices present it is recommended that an alias be defined for each such
device.

Example:
	aliases {
		serial0 = &uart0;       // This device will be called ttyHSL0
	};

	uart0: serial@19c400000 {
		compatible = "qcom,msm-lsuart-v14"
		reg = <0x19c40000 0x1000">;
		interrupts = <195>;
	};
