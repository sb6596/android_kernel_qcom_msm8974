Krait Voltage regulators

Required properties:
- compatible:			Must be "qcom,krait-regulator"
- reg:				Specifies the address and size for this regulator device,
				also specifies the address and the size for the MDD area
				to be used along with the regulator
- reg-names:			"acs" -string to identify the area where main power control
					registers reside.
				"mdd" - string to identify the area where mdd registers reside.
- qcom,headroom-voltage:	The minimum required voltage drop between the input
			 	voltage and the output voltage for the LDO to be
			 	operational, in microvolts. Acceptable values are from
				50000uV to 250000uV
- qcom,retention-voltage:	The value for retention voltage in microvolts. Acceptable
				values are from 465000uV to 750000uV
- qcom,ldo-default-voltage:	The default value for LDO voltage in microvolts. Acceptable
				values are from 465000uV to 750000uV
- qcom,ldo-threshold-voltage:	The voltage value above which LDO is nonfunctional.
				Acceptable values are from 600000uV to 900000uV
- qcom,ldo-delta-voltage:	The delta used to reduce the requested voltage in order
				to derive the LDO output voltage while switching
				to LDO mode. Acceptable values are from 1000uV to 100000uV
- qcom,cpu-num:			Indicates what cpu this regulator controls

Any property defined as part of the core regulator
binding, defined in regulator.txt, can also be used.

Example:
	krait0_vreg: regulator@f9088000 {
		compatible = "qcom,krait-regulator";
		regulator-name = "krait0";
		reg = <0xf9088000 0x1000>, /* APCS_ALIAS0_KPSS_ACS */
			<0xf908a800 0x1000>; /* APCS_ALIAS0_KPSS_MDD */
		reg-names = "acs", "mdd";
		regulator-min-microvolt = <500000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <1100000>;
		qcom,headroom-voltage = <150000>;
		qcom,retention-voltage = <745000>;
		qcom,ldo-default-voltage = <745000>;
		qcom,ldo-threshold-voltage = <750000>;
		qcom,ldo-delta-voltage = <50000>;
		qcom,cpu-num = 0;
	};
